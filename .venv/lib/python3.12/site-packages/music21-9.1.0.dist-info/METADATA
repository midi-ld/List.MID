## Community Code of Conduct ##

`Music21` encourages contributions, discussions, and usage from all people interested in
music and computers. This encouragement extends to all people regardless of (among other aspects)
gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, religion, appearance, veteran status,
gender identity, socioeconomic status, or nationality.

Members of the community will strive to be friendly, patient, and welcoming, especially of
viewpoints and experiences different from our own. We reject harassment and contributions
(in mail, comments, or code) that belittle individuals or groups of people.

We ask all members of the community to be mindful particularly about assumptions of the
gender of users (choice of pronouns in comments and code). We recognize that members
sometimes make mistakes and will, in general, accept sincere regrets for such cases.
Blatant or repeated violations of the code will result in the removal of the
contributor’s participation in the community.

The maintainers of `music21` and associated sites will commit themselves to enforcing
this code of conduct. Users who notice violations, including instances of abuse,
harassment, or otherwise unacceptable behavior are requested to contact 
michael.asato.cuthbert@gmail.com.
Maintainers will respect confidentiality with regard to reports.

## Acknowledgements ##

The development of `music21` has been supported by
the generosity of the Seaver Institute and the
National Endowment for the Humanities.  MIT's Music and Theater Arts Section
and the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences encouraged Cuthbert
in its development.
